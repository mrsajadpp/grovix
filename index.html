<p>API, or Application Programming Interface, Most beginner programmers are
confused about "Actually, what is an API?" That is a link used to connect the
front end with the back end, for example, a login form. First, it is not a
programming language; it acts as a middleman between the browser and the
server. API, also known as web services, restful API, or soap API, is not a
framework or library; it is just a URL. Only APIs can be developed by a
back-end developer. The back-end developer can choose any back-end language to
develop APIs.</p>
<h3>Let's look at a real-life example.</h3>
<p>For example, if
you are in a restaurant, there is a waiter, you, and a cook. In this case, you
are the browser, the waiter is the API, and the cook is the server (backend).
The API is actually working like this: the API is a middleman and can handle
thousands of requests.</p>
<h3>How data travels in an API</h3>
<p>In API data
passing and receiving in the format called JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation,
before the 2000s, we used XML to pass and receive data. XML is very difficult
to read and slower than JSON.</p>

<h3>CRUD operations in APIs</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>CRUD means the four fundamental operations that can be used on data in a
database: create, read, update, and delete. These operations are important to
many RESTful APIs and are required for any application's data management and
manipulation.</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
	<li><strong>Create (POST):</strong> This operation adds new
	data entries to a database. For example, adding a new user.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
	<li><strong>Read (GET): </strong>This operation retrieves data
	from a database. For example, fetching user information.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
	<li><strong>Update (PUT/PATCH):</strong> This operation
	modifies existing data in a database. For example, updating user
	details.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
	<li><strong>Delete (DELETE):
	</strong>This operation removes data from a database. For example, deleting a
	user.</li>
</ol>

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Advantages of
APIs</h4>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
	<li><strong>Communication:</strong> APIs allow interaction of
	many applications and systems, allowing the integration of different
	platforms and technologies.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
	<li><strong>Efficiency: </strong>APIs reduce useless coding
	and speed up project timeframes by simplifying the development process by
	providing predetermined methods and regulations.</li>
</ol>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
	<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> APIs help programs develop
	by allowing the integration of new features and services without affecting
	already-existing functions.</li>
</ol>
